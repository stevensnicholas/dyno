# Parse Library 

The parse library is utilized to parse raw dynamic analysis results into useable results that can be turned into issues. This is achieved by parsing in bug files that are created by dynamic testing tools and parsing them through DynoResult's. Further information on the DynoResult structure can be found [here](../result/README.md).
